Andrews died in October 1883 and was buried at the Basel Kannenfeld Friedhof without any memorial stone; In 1889 some Adventist leaders decided to put a memorial stone in Kannenfeld Friedhof; You ancestor Joseph Waggonner came from the USA and worked at the Adventist publishing house in Basel at this time; In April 1889, he finished his book ""From Paradies to Paradies"" and wanted to publish it in London; The night before his trip to London he died and was discovered in the following morning; Joseph was buried next to John Andrews in Kannenfeld Friedhof; His name appeared on the same memorial stone as it was the same year 1889 when the stone was erected; In the 1950s Kannenfeld Friedhof was destroyed; Unfortunately the Swiss people generally do not use to keep the bones more than 30 years in their cemeteries. Unless the grave belong to rich families: it is called ""perpetual concession""; At this time the Adventist leaders were totally unable to find the bones of their pioneers, Andrews, Waggonner and other people such as Andrews daughter, Edith died in 1885; They founded the original stone that had been transferred in Wolf Friedhof cemetery, a famous on in Basel. The fact that it had been transferred reveals that this stone had been considered as an important one by the people in charge of the cemeteries in Basel. Maybe because on the size: 2 meters high, that is normal today, yet not in the 1950s in Basel. It is here in Wolf Friedhof you may see the memorial stone in 2006.  <|>",People

Ells | Notes unter the article from Aug. 9, 1923: Lewis Henry Ells was born at Conneaut-ville, Pa., March 21, 1836; and died at College Place, Wash., May 22, 1923. His early childhood was spent in the State of New York, but at the age of eleven he with hiÃÂ» parents moved to Wisconsin, where he grew to manhood. New Year's Day, 1861, he was united in marriage with Miss Mary A. Farrar, of Kingston, Wis. The year following he moved to Minnesota, and settled near the town of Kenyon. Soon after this he heard the third angel's message, and embraced it with all his heart, casting in his   lot   with   the   advent  people. The advent message so filled his heart that he felt he must be doing something to warn the people of the soon coming of the Lord. In 1867 he raised up a company of Sabbath keepers, and was ordained aÃÂ» their elder. He soon felt called to preach the gospel, and in May, 1872, received bÃÂ» first license to preach. A short time after this he wa6 ordained to the gospel ministry^ and was always true and faithful to the charge. He was one of that company of stanch and true ministers who suffered hardship* and privations while pioneering for the truth in the great State of Minnesota. By 1901. the rigorous climate of those Northern States had so affected his constitution that his health failed, and he found it necessary to seek another climate; so he came weat to Idaho, where he rested from active labor for a time. About fifteen years ago ^ÃÂ»* Lord graciously healed His servant, and with health restored, he again took up acti** labor,  and   spent  several  years  in the field"" In 1912 he was called upon to part with his companion, who had so jjobly stood pT hi6 side in all his labors, encouraging niÃÂ» by her faithful and earnest life. Her death was the greatest sorrow of his life. 1*** years that passed were very lonely, although his children did all in their power to ÃÂ»&a** his life pleasant and happy. When his'STU""-mons came, he was ready and waiting.-a** fell peacefully asleep without a strugtf*** Tt could be said of him, "" A sheaf of wheat fully ripe, ready for the garner of God.** Ã¢âÂ  A.

His opposing relatives, fearing that he would come to penury, had a guardian appointed to look after his business. He bore his embarrassment with Christian fortitude. After a few years Providence intervened in his behalf. A torrential rain visited Topsham and washed out the bridge crossing the Kenebeck river. Howland was known to be and expert  bridge builder, so his neighbors and friends tried to persuade him to build the new bridge. But he said, ""How can I? Better see my guardian."" The result was that the Court set aside the guardianship and a contract was made with Howland to construct the bridge. Many were to apologies that were made when it was revealed taht the action taken was really persecution. On the completion of the bridge, the way was open to remove to Battle Creek, where he purchaded a residence at 261 Champion St. In the old Maine home, however, the sons of Eld. and Mrs. White had found a truly Christian home, allowing the parents to remain nearly constantly in the field. Henry N. White died in the Howland home at Topsham in 1863. Father Howland died April 7, 1883, aged 82 years; and his wife, March 2, 1897, aged 91 years. Their beloved daughters, Mrs. H. C. Winslow and Frances H. Lunt also died in Battle Creek and they all repose on the family lot in Oak Hill. ""Their works do follow them."" ",People

Perhaps the name Battle Creek sounded too beligerent for a man of peace. He favored strongly the Indian name, Waupakisco, urging that a nickname from that word could only be ""Waupasiscans"", while Battle Creek would form an easy change to ""Battle Creekites."" That was too much like Jubusites and Hittites for him. In a general vote, Mr. Hussey was defeated by 60 votes.<br>At one time Erastus Hussey was mayor of the city and for a long time he was a prosperous merchant. He was a strong ""Anti Slavery"" man, an abolitionist of the severe type, edited a peper called ""The Liberty Press"", always an up-to-date Michigan abolitionist paper. But he did more than edit the type of paper he did, - he kept a station on the ""Underground Railroad"" for the accommodation of runaway slaves; and his station was in the celar of his home shown above under the title, ""Old Homestead"", and which stood where the central or first building of BattleCCreek College stands. Mr. Hussey owned twelve acres for his historic home site, purchasing the plot in 1855. In 1874, he sold the tract to the Seventh-day Adventist Educational Society, and erected a beautiful home at the norh-west corner of Washington and Manchester streets, where the College Library now stands, and his home was moved a few lots west on Manchester St. It is estimated that the Husseys assisted more than 1000 slaves.",People

Mr. Smith was a blacksmith by trade, a Republican in politics, and a Seventh Day Adventist in religion. He was a man of strong mind, quick perceptions, and sound and persuasive reasons, and was gifted with the abilities to make his ideas known in few words. In 1843 he embraced the doctrines of the Millerites, and was so enthusiastic in expounding their doctrines that he soon acquired a wide reputation, being caricatured by the illustrated papers of New York, and quoted by the defenders of his faith both near and far. He was an honest and industrious man, and as such was respected by his neighbors. Several children survive him. w.",People

White | Letter: CCC to WCW - March 21, 1916<br>Bro. A. D. Fowler, the-San. nurse who a few month ago returned from Australia, brought down. picture a few days ago, an enlargement of one he had snappshotted of your Mother while she was speaking to the children at a Chruch-school Picnig, June 15, 1913 - while we were both in the East, attending the General conference. The picture looked natural enough to be worth while, and I asked him for a copy for myself and one for you. I am sending you the same under separate cover. My copy is a little smaller in size (this is an enlargement, of course, of a small kodak picture); sometimes I think the smaller size is better, and sometimes I think the larger size better. I have purchased this negative, for a dollar, thinking you would wish to have it within your control in future. I imagine that a real artist-photographer could producea a really good picture from it. It seems to be rather the most natural of all the recent pictures - not very good, perhaps, for publication, but precious to those wo were close to her in her old age.<br>Fowlers's camera had a very high-grade lense - a ""GRAPHLEX,"" I understand - and this is why he could get such a picture while your Mother was speaking. Furtunatly her mouth was closed when the snap was taken.<br>One of the children present is to be traced in the haze to the right of the head.<br>I will not attempt a long letter this moring. We are in good health, and of excellent courage. I am not planning on having the Malachi and Messianic matter ready before your return, but hope to have it by that time.<br>Brother James' leg is much better, and he is able to do some plowing now, much to his delight.<br>With love, Yours as ever, William Clearance White",People

Photo taken 1868. <|>The opening of the Western Health Reform Institute on September 5, 1866, marked a new era in SDA history. This was to be not only the forerunner of Battle Creek Sanitarium but of a whole system of healthcare facukutue operated around the world. Dr. H. S. Lay was the first head physician. He was soon joined by the denominationÂ«s first female physician, Dr. Phoebe Lamson. Ellen White urged that the new institution ever keep in view its purpose to work from ""a high religious standpoint,"" and not to unduly pattern itself after Dr. JacksonÂ«s institution at Dansville. In 1875 Dr. John Harvey Kellog joined the staff and was appointed medical superintendent the next year at the age of 24. By 1877 a second building was erected and the institution was renamed the Medical and Surgical Sanitarium, later commonly called the Battle Creek Sanitarium.<|>",Institutions
123.jpg,6335afad98fb3abf19a9e0ee6bc852d2,"Battle Creek Sanitarium. <|>The Medical and Surgical Sanitarium (Battle Creek ""San"") was dedicated in April 1878. The four-story building was 136 feet (41m) in length. During the next 20 years, continued growth in patronage led to major expansion: In 1884 a five story addition was built containing a gymnasium and dining facilities; in 1887 a separate five story hospital structure was erected; in 1890 another five-story extension was added to the main building and the original structure was raised one story; in 1894 a five story brick dormitory was erected to accommodate 150 or more nurses; in in 1895 further additions were made including a chapel seating about 400. By the turn of the century the Sanitarium was world-famous and employed more than 900 workers. Ellen White gave numerous warnings that the institution and its leaders were never to lose sight of the SanitariumÂ«s divinely-appointed mission that was to distinguished it from secular institutions. She also warned against concentrating so much investment in one place, as well as placing in only a few hands the power and control over the various medical institutions serving the church. <|>",Institutions

The hotel has been erected in the center of a vine-growing district on a fertile farm embracing over 1,500 acres of the La Jota Rancho, from which its excellent table is supplied with milk, fruit and vegetables. The drinking water has been shown by analysis to be absolutely pure, containing no deleterious ingredients. There is also a Chalybeate spring which acts as a very agreeable bookmaking tonic. The swimming tank, which is 100 feet by 40 feet and kept at a temperature of 70 to 78 degrees Fahrenheit, is second to none. There are also tennis courts, croquet grounds and a charming country for riding and driving. Situated at an elevation of 1,750 feet above the sea level (and only 70 miles from San Francisco), the climate being unsurpassed, AngwinÂ«s affords the most convenient health and summer resort in California. Three trains leave San Francisco daily for St. Helena, thence by carriage or stage to AngwinÂ«s. Terms, $10.00 and $14.00 per week. Long distance telephone to all parts of the state.<|>",Institutions
